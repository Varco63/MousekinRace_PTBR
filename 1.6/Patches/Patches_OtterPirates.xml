					Set player and NPC faction relations between Otters and Mousekins 
					
					Otters are fairly pretty chill when dealing with various Mousekin factions, but are noticeably friendlier towards the Mousekin Kingdom faction; it is said that back when the current Mousekin King was only a prince, he owed his life to a group of Otters that saved him from drowning during an ill-advised attempt to circumnavigate the planet in a flimsy Mousekin coracle, and he rewarded them handsomely with annual payments of shiny pebbles to this very day
